# Semester Project 2 - Swift Auction

![image](/public/images/website-screenshot.png)

## Description

This is my contribution to the FED2 program's semester project. In this project we had to use all the skills we have learned in the past three semesters.

I have built a front-end user interface for an existing API auction application. The website has to be responsive and allow users to view dynamic auction listings. I named my auction website "Swift Auction". We had been given user stories to fulfil, which are listed down below.

We were required to use a planning application and a design application. We also had to deploy the project to a hosting service.

It was also a requirement to use a CSS framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind or MUI), I chose Tailwind for my project.

### The brief

This is the project brief:

"An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings."

All API functionality is managed by an existing application. The API used in the project can be found under Auction Endpoints in the [Noroff API Documentation](https://docs.noroff.dev/docs/v2).

### User stories

1. A user with a stud.noroff.no email may register.
2. A registered user may login.
3. A registered user may logout.
4. A registered user may update their avatar.
5. A registered user may view their total credit.
6. A registered user may create a Listing with a title, deadline date, media gallery and description.
7. A registered user may add a Bid to another userâ€™s Listing.
8. A registered user may view Bids made on a Listing.
9. An unregistered user may search through Listings.
